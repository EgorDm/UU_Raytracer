How to run: Open index.html in browser. (Please use a modern browser like chrome)
Files:
source.js - Commented source code
compiled.js - Minified source code
index.html - Contains tags to instruct browser to run javascript code

Source code size(compiled.js): 888bytes
Minified with google closure and then by hand :S

Note: Html only adds the ui to this code. It can also be printed to string instead.
If you consider this as unfair. I refer you to use inlined-index.html where
html and javascript are both in 1 file. Which is 921 bytes
